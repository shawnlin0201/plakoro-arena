"""Split the 秘笈手冊 PDF into the units that are sold separately.

Why the PDF rather than the structured conversion: the book is built out of tables and
diagrams laid out on a page, and every conversion route lost something — images matched to the
wrong paragraph, cells parsed empty, in-cell line breaks eaten so three expected values read as
one number. A PDF is what the authors see. The cost is real and worth stating: no search across
chapters, and fixed-layout pages are harder to read on a phone.

Chapter boundaries come from the PDF's own outline, which Google Docs writes from the heading
styles — not from guessing at page numbers.

Each unit becomes its own file, and that is the whole point of the design: there is never a
file, and never an endpoint, that hands over the entire book. A player's entitlement is checked
per unit (`player_unlocks.kind = 'handbook'`, `asset` = the unit id used here), and only those
bytes are served.

Page numbers restart at 1 in every unit. The source carries no printed page numbers, so this
needs nothing stamped — a reader simply sees "page 3 of 7" within the chapter they bought.
