//
// The odds view answers "can I pay for this move?". This answers "what is it worth when I
// do?" — as the HP swing the move produces: damage dealt to the opponent, minus damage it
// costs its own user. A heal is stored as negative self-damage in the data (see the -20 on
// EBW01-025 はねやすめ), so that one subtraction covers healing too.
//
// The effect semantics mirror runEffectQueue in effectQueue.js, but where the queue asks the
// player what a sub-roll actually produced, this takes its expectation instead. The two must
// stay in step: any change to an effect's meaning there needs the matching change here.
//
// Weakness is deliberately excluded. The calculator has no opponent to look up a weakness on,
// and the question it exists to answer — "which of this character's moves is worth casting
// with the dice I've built?" — is not changed by a flat bonus that lands on whichever move
// happens to match the defender's type.
//
// An effect type with no handler is reported through `notes` rather than silently valued at
// zero, so a new card pulled in by `npm run fetch-data` surfaces as unsupported instead of
// quietly skewing the numbers.
