// Every character measured against the others, each on the dice a player would build for
// them (see suggestedDice.js) — comparing a roster on one shared build mostly reports whose
// type that build happened to be.
//
// The hard part is the eight printed moves that only pay out under a condition. Scoring them
// as if the condition never holds understates a character built around one; scoring them as
// if it always holds is worse, since three of ルカリオ's four best moves want it to be losing
// and it would ride that to the top of the table. What separates the two cases is who
// decides:
//
//   - Conditions the caster elects (「前の自分の番、どくガスが成功していたなら」) cost a turn
//     to arrange, so the move is priced as the whole sequence: the enabler's own turn averaged
//     in with the payoff. That is not a penalty invented to be fair — it is what the sequence
//     is worth, and for the one printed combo it comes out below simply attacking twice, so
//     the character gains nothing. The alternative is taken whenever it wins.
//   - Conditions nobody elects (being under 40 HP, the dice having failed last turn) are
//     weighted by how often they actually hold, at frequencies derived from the roster rather
//     than chosen.
//
// Two metrics are offered because they answer different questions. The top-N average asks
// how strong a character's best moves are; the per-turn value asks what an average turn is
// worth, splitting the game into HP bands and taking the best move available in each. The
// second handles conditional moves natively — a low-HP finisher counts fully in the band
// where it can be cast and not at all elsewhere — while the first has to weight them.
//
// A third framing, tempting and wrong, is to score a conditional move as "its value when the
// condition holds, else whatever I'd have cast instead". That reads as the obvious reading of
// "I only cast it when it lands", but it charges the fallback move's value to the conditional
// move's name: カイロス's ぎゃくじょうスイング scores 27.4 that way, higher than the 24.0 it is
// worth even when the condition does hold, and every character with a conditional move gets
// its best move counted twice over. It measures what a turn is worth, not what a move is
// worth — which is the per-turn metric's job, done properly, below.
