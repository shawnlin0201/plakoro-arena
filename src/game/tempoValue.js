// What it's worth to take something away from the opponent — a die, their character die,
// their damage, one of their moves — expressed in the same HP currency as the rest of the
// expected-value model, so it can be added to a move's figure rather than sitting beside it.
//
// Every one of those effects is the same question, so they share one estimator:
//
//   value = the best expected value the opponent could commit to  -  the best they can
//           commit to under the restriction
//
// It has to be a maximum over their moves at each restriction, not one move re-scored: the
// move is chosen before the dice are thrown (pickMove -> diceRoll), so a player denied a die
// picks a cheaper move rather than casting the expensive one and failing. Roughly a quarter
// of the roster does exactly that when a die is taken away.
//
// Two things this deliberately does NOT do:
//
//   - It doesn't consult the player's own dice. The opponent brings dice suited to their own
//     moves, so assuming they roll the player's build understates their baseline (a build
//     tuned for one character is a poor build for another) and halves the answer. Their build
//     is inferred from what their own moves cost instead.
//   - It doesn't recurse. Valuing the opponent's tempo moves needs a table, and building the
//     table needs the opponent's values. The way out is iteration, not recursion: the first
//     pass values their tempo moves at zero, and each later pass re-runs the whole table with
//     the previous pass's numbers standing in. Left at pass one, "you may deal no damage next
//     turn" reads as "you may do nothing next turn", which overvalues it by about a fifth.
//     Three passes reach a fixed point.
//
// One more thing it does NOT do: average over everybody. See REFERENCE_COUNT.
