// venue is invisible to the laptop at home. This is how one travels: a single JSON file that can
// be imported back and carried on with, or kept as the record of what happened.
//
// Written to be legible. The internal representation references players by uuid, which is right
// for the running app and useless in a file someone opens to check a result — "player1Id":
// "a3f2-…" tells a reader nothing. Here a match names the people in it. The cost is that names
// have to be unique within a tournament to be unambiguous, which `ref` below handles.
//
// Round-tripping has to be lossless: re-pairing a round from a half-restored tournament would
// produce different pairings than the ones people actually played, and the standings with them.
