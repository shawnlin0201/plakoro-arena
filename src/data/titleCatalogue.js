// Every title that exists. One kind of thing — a title — listed in the groups a player would
// look for them in.
//
// What differs between them is only how one is come by. Some are awarded by an event for where
// you finished, and carry that event's name; some are awarded for something that happened at
// the table, and carry the condition that unlocks them. Both are earned, never typed in: a
// profile screen that could set a title would make every one of them worthless.
//
// `rank` is what the nameplate colours it by; see TITLE_RANKS in game/playerBadges.js.
// Placement titles take the metal that matches the finish, so colour and words agree.
//
// `condition` is shown beside a title so a player can see what it takes, whether or not they
// hold it. Nothing checks these yet — the battle detail that would prove them isn't recorded —
// so they are awarded by hand for now.
